## What is React Query?

![react query](./assets/react-query.svg)

From <https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview>:

<Block sx={{
  width: '50%'
}}>

> React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

</Block>

---

## But what does that mean?

<Step styles={{
  before: {display: 'none'},
  current: {display: '', transition: 'all 0.2s ease-out'},
  after: {display: 'none'}
}}
>

<Block>

It replaces this

```js file=./examples/before.js

```

</Block>

<Block>

With this

```js file=./examples/after.js

```

</Block>

## What is React Query?

### What does it do?

<StepTransition>

- Reduces boilerplate around API calls,
- Manages caching for us so we don't have to reach for Redux,
- Provides loading, error, and success states,
- And does _a lot_ more that we probably won't get to cover here.

</StepTransition>

<Note>

Remember that React Query is new to me, too, and I'm still learning it.
There's a lot that it offers that can help us, and I'm learning more about it as we use it in the Drayage project

## Query basics

### Query keys

<StepTransition>

<Block>

From <https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/query-keys>:

> At its core, React Query manages query caching for you based on query keys. Query keys can be as simple as a string, or as complex as an array of many strings and nested objects. As long as the query key is serializable, and **unique to the query's data**, you can use it!

</Block>

Query keys are important because they uniquely describe the data being fetched, and that is what is used for efficient caching and refetching of data.

</StepTransition>

---

## Query basics

### Query keys

> If your query function depends on a variable, include it in your query key. Since query keys uniquely describe the data they are fetching, they should include any variables you use in your query function that change. For example:

```js
function Todos({todoId}) {
  const result = useQuery(['todos', todoId], () => fetchTodoById(todoId));
}
```

From <https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/query-keys>:

It's useful to think of these array query keys as analogous to the dependencies in a `useEffect` dependency array.

<Note>

Most of our queries involve some kind of id, so most array query keys will include at least two elements: the descriptor of the query and the id it depends on.

</Note>

---

## Query basics

### Query functions

<StepTransition>

<Block>

From <https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/query-functions>:

> A query function can be literally any function that **returns a promise**. The promise that is returned should either **resolve the data** or **throw an error**.

</Block>

This should sound very familiar: it exactly describes our _existing_ API wrapper functions. This means we can use React Query for any API interaction, right now.

</StepTransition>

---

## Query basics

### Query functions

```js file=./examples/accessorials.js

```

`fetchAccessorialCodesPromise` is an existing API wrapper function that lives in `frontend-web` today, and we can use it with `useQuery` as-is.

---

## Query basics

### Query result

<StepTransition>

- `data` is the main event: it holds the result that the query function resolved to.
- `error` contains any error that the query function threw.
- `refetch` lets us imperatively re-query for data. This is rarely needed, but comes in handy when it is.
- Many status booleans that will let us conditionally render the results of the query.

</StepTransition>

---

## Mutation basics

<StepTransition>

<Block>

From <https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/mutations>:

> Unlike queries, mutations are typically used to create/update/delete data or perform server side-effects. For this purpose, React Query exports a `useMutation` hook.

</Block>

A mutation is any API request that modifies data on the backend: most POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The signature for a mutation is slightly different, which is why React Query provides a separate `useMutation` hook.

</StepTransition>

---

## Mutation basics

<StepTransition>

<Block>

```js
function App() {
  const mutation = useMutation((newTodo) => axios.post('/todos', newTodo));

  if (mutation.isLoading) {
    return 'Adding todo…';
  }
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        mutation.mutate({id: new Date(), title: 'Do Laundry'});
      }}>
      Create Todo
    </button>
  );
}
```

Example adapted from <https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/mutations>.

</Block>

<StepTransition>

- Mutations do not have query keys because they aren't cached.
- `mutate` takes a single argument.
  - For API methods that take multiple arguments, destructure in the mutation function.
  - `useMutation({shipmentId, shipmentDetails}) => updateShipment(shipmentId, shipmentDetails));`
- `mutateAsync` is a Promise-based API for mutations, which is useful when we need to chain requests.
  - The signature is the same as `mutate`, but the promise it returns resolves with `data` on success or throws.

</StepTransition>

</StepTransition>

<Note>

`mutateAsync`: `mutate` updates the state of the mutation object, and for longer-running mutations this can result in a loading state for some time.
`mutateAsync` lets us wait for that long-running request to settle so we can chain other API interactions to it.

</Note>

---

## What does React Query _not_ do or change?

<StepTransition>

<StepTransition>

- Our API wrappers remain exactly the same: we can use them as-is as query functions.
- Any truly local/client state management is not covered by React Query
  - We don't have much (or any) of this, but client state is e.g. layout state or current theme
- React Query cannot replace _all_ API/async fetching calls in our app.
  - Components that need an async way to load data, e.g. async react-select.

</StepTransition>

<StepTransition>

```js file=./examples/react-select.js

```

</StepTransition>

</StepTransition>

<Note>

The react-select example is an edge case, but I wanted te bring it up to showcase how RQ doesn't apply to all cases _and_ to show how we can still use it to reduce boilerplate.

</Note>

## How does React Query fit into `shipwell/frontend-web`?

<StepTransition>

- Almost all of these examples are taken from our existing codebase, except where noted.
- We can use React Query for existing API interactions right now.
  - We are using this for Drayage work, but we can all use it in new work right now.
- No more boilerplate for requests, loading, and error states: React Query includes all this.
- Caching happens automatically.
  - We can put (re-usable) queries in the components that need that data, regardless of the component hierarchy.
- Testing?
  - We mock API wrappers in exactly the same way we currently do – nothing changes.
  - `makeWrapper` in `App/test-utils` already has a `<QueryClientProvider>` wrapper.

</StepTransition>

<Note>

Examples _not_ taken from `frontend-web` are taken or adapted directly from the RQ docs.

Caching: This means we don't have to worry about making a request in a parent component and passing the data down to its children (or storing it in redux) to reduce network calls.

Testing: any component that uses `useQuery` or `useMutation` needs the `<QueryClientProvider>` wrapper, but it's provided automatically by `makeWrapper`.
</Note>

## Examples

<StepTransition>

- Basic <https://react-query.tanstack.com/examples/basic>
- Custom hook <https://react-query.tanstack.com/examples/custom-hooks>
- Updates from mutation response <https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/updates-from-mutation-responses>

</StepTransition>

---

## What's next?

<StepTransition>

- React Query devtools <https://react-query.tanstack.com/devtools>
  - Try them out today by adding `REACT_QUERY_DEVTOOLS=true` to `.env` (copy `.env.local` first) and running `npm run serve`.
- Dependent queries
- Reusable hooks
- Optimistic updates
- Prefetching

</StepTransition>

<Note>

- Dependent queries will be used quite often to defer queries until we have some other piece of data.
- Reusable hooks can be useful for widely- or commonly-used queries and mutations. And optimistic updates, if we decide to use them.
- Optimistic updates (and rollbacks) are an optimization but can help to make long-running queries or mutatinos seem faster.
- Prefetching could be super useful for things like Compass.
