## What is React Query?

![react query](./assets/react-query.svg)

From <https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview>:

<Block sx={{
  width: '50%'
}}>

> React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

</Block>

## But what does that mean?

<Step styles={{
  before: {display: 'none'},
  current: {display: '', transition: 'all 0.2s ease-out'},
  after: {display: 'none'}
}}
>

<Block>

It replaces this

```js file=./before.js

```

</Block>

<Block>

With this

```js file=./after.js

```

</Block>

## React Query

- Reduces boilerplate around API calls,
- Manages caching for us so we don't have to reach for Redux,
- Provides loading, error, and success states,
- And does _a lot_ more that we probably won't get to cover here.
